Meta-analysis of the efficacy and safety of tirofiban in patients with acute ischaemic stroke undergoing mechanical thrombectomy.,"Liu C, Yang X, Liu M, Wang J, Li G",2023,Clinical neurology and neurosurgery,10.1016/j.clineuro.2023.107702,37058772,Journal Article,"Mechanical thrombectomy is now widely used in acute ischaemic stroke, but its adjunctive antiplatelet aggregation regimen is controversial. This study aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of tirofiban in patients with acute ischaemic stroke (AIS) who underwent mechanical thrombectomy. We systematically searched Pubmed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of science. Randomized controlled studies and cohort studies comparing the tirofiban group and non-tirofiban group (control group) in patients with AIS who underwent mechanical thrombectomy. The primary safety outcomes were symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH), 3-month mortality, and re-occlusion rate. The primary efficacy outcomes were good functional outcome (mRS 0-2), excellent functional outcome (mRS 0-1), and successful recanalization (mTICI≥2b). We included 22 studies with a total of 6062 patients. For safety outcomes, the tirofiban group had a non-significantly higher rate of sICH (OR = 0.90, 95 % CI = 0.73-1.10, P = 0.29) and a significantly lower rate of re-occlusion (OR = 0.40, 95 % CI = 0.19-0.82, P = 0.01) and 3-month mortality (OR = 0.71, 95 % CI = 0.61-0.82, P < 0.00001) compared to the control group. In terms of efficacy outcomes, significant improvement in good functional outcomes (mRS 0-2) (OR = 1.24, 95 % CI = 1.11-1.39, P = 0.0002) and recanalization rate (OR = 1.38, 95% CI = 1.17-1.62, P = 0.0001) compared to tirofiban, but not significant improvement in excellent functional outcomes(OR = 1.14, 95 % CI = 0.93-1.39, P = 0.21). In addition, compared with cardiogenic stroke, the large atherosclerotic stroke had a higher rate of good functional outcome (OR = 1.58, 95 % CI = 1.18-2.11, P = 0.002) and a lower rate of 3-month mortality (OR = 0.58, 95 % CI = 0.39-0.85, P = 0.005). Subgroup analysis by route of administration showed a significant improvement in good functional outcome in the intravenous group (OR = 1.27, 95 % CI = 1.08-1.50, P = 0.004), while no significant difference was found between the arterial and arteriovenous groups. Treatment with tirofiban in patients with AIS with mechanical thrombectomy is effective in improving functional prognosis, arterial recanalization rates, and reducing 3-month mortality and re-occlusion rates, particularly in patients with large atherosclerotic stroke, without increasing the rate of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage. Intravenous administration of tirofiban significantly improves the clinical prognosis compared to arterial administration. Tirofiban is effective and safe in patients with AIS.",Humans; Brain Ischemia; Intracranial Hemorrhages; Ischemic Stroke; Stroke; Thrombectomy; Tirofiban; Treatment Outcome; Acute ischaemic stroke; Mechanical thrombectomy; Thrombus; Tirofiban,Systematic Review and Meta-analysis,Ischemic Stroke,NA,Mechanical Thrombectomy,Tirofiban,80
Intensive Blood Pressure Control After Mechanical Thrombectomy for Acute Ischemic Stroke.,"Morris NA, Jindal G, Chaturvedi S",2023,Stroke,10.1161/STROKEAHA.122.041949,37021566,Journal Article,"Optimal blood pressure targets following successful mechanical thrombectomy remain uncertain. While some observational studies suggest that the relationship between blood pressure and outcomes follows a <i>U</i>-shaped curve, others suggest a linear relationship where lower is better. The recent BP-TARGET study (Blood Pressure Target in Acute Stroke to Reduce Hemorrhage After Endovascular Therapy) did not find a benefit to intensive blood pressure lowering regarding the risk of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, but it was not sufficiently powered to detect differences in functional outcomes. On its heels arrived the ENCHANTED2 (Enhanced Control of Hypertension and Thrombectomy Stroke Study)/mechanical thrombectomy trial, the first trial of intensive blood pressure lowering in patients with hypertension following successful mechanical thrombectomy powered to detect a difference in functional outcomes. The trial randomized patients to either a systolic blood pressure less than 120 or 140 to 180 mm Hg. The trial was terminated early due to safety concerns in the more intensive blood pressure-lowering group. In this emerging therapy critique, we explore concerns regarding the generalizability of ENCHANTED2/mechanical thrombectomy, including the high prevalence of intracranial atherosclerosis in the studied population. We survey mechanisms for poor outcomes in patients who receive overly aggressive blood pressure reduction following successful thrombectomy, such as poststroke autoregulatory compromise and persistent microcirculatory hypoperfusion. Finally, we advocate for a more moderate approach, pending further research.",Humans; Ischemic Stroke; Brain Ischemia; Blood Pressure; Microcirculation; Stroke; Hypertension; Thrombectomy; Treatment Outcome; Endovascular Procedures; blood pressure; intracranial hemorrhage; reperfusion; stroke; thrombectomy,Editorial/Commentary/Opinion/Letter to the Editor,Ischemic Stroke,NA,Mechanical Thrombectomy,NA,70

High-flow arteriovenous malformation in the finger with transvenous ethanolamine oleate sclerotherapy using an arterial tourniquet and microballoon occlusion: A case report.,"Tannai H, Oguro S, Nagao M, Ota H, Takase K",2023,Radiology case reports,10.1016/j.radcr.2023.02.048,36970241,Case Reports,"Endovascular therapy is an important method of treating high-flow arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). The nidus of AVMs can be treated by transarterial or percutaneous approaches with the use of ethanol as a strong embolic agent; however, treatment outcomes are not always satisfactory and complications including skin necrosis often occur, particularly following the treatment of superficial lesions. Herein, we describe successful transvenous sclerotherapy of high-flow AVMs in the finger of a 47-year-old female patient that were causing erythema and spontaneous pain using ethanolamine oleate (EO) as a safe sclerosant. Dynamic contrast-enhanced computed tomography and angiography revealed a high-flow type Ⅲb AVM according to Yakes classification. Using the transvenous approach, 5% EO with idoxanol was injected into the nidus of the AVM 3 times over 2 sessions. An arterial tourniquet was used to achieve stasis of blood flow at the nidus and microballoon occlusion of the outflow vein was used to ensure the sclerosant effectively reached the nidus. Near-total occlusion of the nidus was achieved leading to improved symptoms. Mild edema lasting 2 weeks occurred as a minor reaction after each session. Finger amputation may have been avoided by using this treatment. Transvenous EO sclerotherapy using an arterial tourniquet and balloon occlusion may have utility in treating AVMs in the extremities.",Arteriovenous malformation; Endovascular; Ethanolamine oleate; Sclerotherapy,Case Report,Arteriovenous Malformation,NA,Transvenous,Ethanolamine Oleate,60
