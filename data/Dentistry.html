<p>Here is our research update for Monday 08 May 2023. Today's update features two studies published in the Journal of Clinical Periodontology that focus on the development of a core outcome set (COS) and measurements in implant dentistry research. The studies highlight the importance of involving people with lived experience (PWLE) in the development of COS and utilizing a multi-stakeholder approach to identify essential outcomes in implant dentistry. The studies provide valuable insights for improving patient outcomes and standardizing research in the field.</p>

<p>In the Journal of Clinical Periodontology, Needleman et al. describe the Implant Dentistry-Core Outcomes Sets and Measures (ID-COSM) project, which aimed to establish outcomes for dental implant research that are important to people with lived experience (PWLE) and achieve consensus with those developed by dental professionals (DPs) for a core outcome set (COS). The study employed calibrated methods across two low-middle-income countries (China and Malaysia) and two high-income countries (Spain and the United Kingdom) to identify outcomes from focus groups with PWLE. The outcomes were then incorporated into a three-stage Delphi process with PWLE participation, and consensus between PWLE and DPs was achieved using a mixed live and recorded platform. The study found that engaging PWLE in COS development can be achieved across widely different communities and broadened and enriched overall outcome consensus, yielding important and novel perspectives for health-related research.</p>

<p>In the Journal of Clinical Periodontology, Sanz et al. describe the ID-COSM initiative, which aimed to identify a core outcome set and measurements in implant dentistry using the Delphi methodology. The study utilized a multi-stakeholder approach, including dental professionals, industry-related experts, and people with lived experience in dental implants. The steering committee selected 100 candidate outcomes from 665 potential outcomes identified in systematic reviews and 89 in focus groups. A three-round Delphi survey was conducted, resulting in 13 essential outcomes organized into four core areas. The study utilized a standardized, transparent, and inclusive methodology and informed the final stage of the ID-COSM consensus. This study is noteworthy for its comprehensive approach to identifying essential outcomes in implant dentistry and its potential to improve patient outcomes and standardize research in the field.</p>
