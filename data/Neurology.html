<p>Here is our research update for Wednesday 17 May 2023. Today's studies focus on <strong>Wilson's disease</strong>, a genetic disorder that affects copper homeostasis and can lead to copper accumulation in various organs, including the liver and central nervous system. The studies highlight the challenges in diagnosing and treating the disease, and provide practical guidance for healthcare providers to improve patient management.</p>
<h4>Wilson's disease</h4>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37184530"><strong>Wilson disease: a summary of the updated AASLD Practice Guidance.</strong></a></p>
<p>Alkhouri et al. provide a review of the updated AASLD Practice Guidance for Wilson disease (WD) in Hepatology Communications. WD is a genetic disorder that affects copper homeostasis and can lead to copper accumulation in various organs, including the liver and central nervous system. The authors highlight the challenges in diagnosing and treating WD, which can result in disability and death. Standard-of-care treatments are effective when diagnosed early, but are limited by safety concerns, multiple daily dosing, and adherence. The review aims to improve awareness, understanding, diagnosis, and management of WD by providing a practical overview of the updated guidance. This review is important for healthcare providers to improve the management of patients with WD.</p>
