<h3>17 May 2023</h3>
<p>Here is our research update for Wednesday 17 May 2023. Today's studies focus on <strong>carotid stenosis</strong>, with a particular emphasis on the use of <strong>radiomics</strong> to identify vulnerable plaques and improve risk stratification.</p>
<h4>Carotid stenosis</h4>

<p>Shi et al. conducted a retrospective cohort study published in Clinical Neuroradiology to develop and validate a combined model incorporating conventional clinical and imaging characteristics and radiomics signatures based on head and neck computed tomography angiography (CTA) to assess plaque vulnerability in patients with carotid stenosis. The study included 167 patients who underwent head and neck CTA and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) within 1 month. The authors found that radiomics signatures of carotid plaque on CTA can well predict plaque vulnerability, which may provide additional value to identify high-risk patients and improve outcomes. The combined model outperformed the conventional and radiomics models in predicting symptomatic plaques. Noteworthy findings include the independent association of homocysteine, plaque ulceration, and carotid rim sign with symptomatic status. The study highlights the potential of radiomics in improving risk stratification in patients with carotid stenosis.</p>
