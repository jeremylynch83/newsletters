<h1>08 May 2023</h1>
<p>Here is our research update for Monday 08 May 2023, featuring studies on intracranial aneurysm, stroke, and intracranial hemorrhage. One study found that silent magnetic resonance angiography could be a useful tool for monitoring patients with intracranial aneurysms treated with a flow re-direction endoluminal device. Another study highlighted the importance of stent-retriever tip design in reducing distal embolization during mechanical thrombectomy for stroke patients. A third study assessed the interobserver agreement on the presence and type of intracranial hemorrhage on magnetic resonance imaging in patients with ischemic stroke.</p>
<p>Upcoming events include World Thrombectomy Day on May 13th, the International Stroke Thrombectomy and Aneurysm Registry symposium on May 11th, the 9th European Stroke Organisation Conference on May 24th, LINNC Paris 2023 on June 5th, and the Basic and Advanced Neurovascular Anatomy Zoom congress on June 4th.</p>
<h3>Intracranial aneurysm</h3>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37151078"><strong>Usefulness of silent magnetic resonance angiography for intracranial aneurysms treated with a flow re-direction endoluminal device.</strong></a></p>
<p>In a retrospective cohort study published in Interventional Neuroradiology, Suzuki et al. compared the efficacy of silent magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and conventional time-of-flight (TOF)-MRA for imaging intracranial aneurysms treated with a flow re-direction endoluminal device (FRED). The study found that silent MRA, a new MRA method using ultra-short time of echo and arterial spin-labeling, was superior to TOF-MRA for assessing patients treated with FRED, with potential as an alternative imaging modality to digital subtraction angiography (DSA). The mean scores for intra-aneurysmal flow and stented parent arteries were significantly better for silent MRA than for TOF-MRA. The study suggests that silent MRA could be a useful tool for monitoring patients with intracranial aneurysms treated with FRED, particularly in cases where DSA is not feasible.</p>
<h3>Stroke</h3>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37147003"><strong>Impact of stent-retriever tip design on distal embolization during mechanical thrombectomy: a randomized in vitro evaluation.</strong></a></p>
<p>Li et al. conducted an in vitro evaluation to assess the impact of stent-retriever tip design on distal embolization during mechanical thrombectomy (MT) for acute ischemic stroke. The study, published in the Journal of Neurointerventional Surgery, compared the recanalization and embolic outcomes of three stent-retrievers: open-tip SR (Solitaire X 6×40 mm), closed-tip SR (EmboTrap II 5×33 mm), and filter-tip SR (NeVa NET 5.5×37 mm). The results showed that the filter-tip SR significantly reduced the number of large clots (&gt;1 mm) that embolize distally during an MT procedure, which may increase the chances of first-pass complete recanalization. The study highlights the importance of stent-retriever tip design in reducing distal embolization during MT and improving clinical outcomes for stroke patients.</p>
<h3>Intracranial hemorrhage</h3>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37154054"><strong>Interobserver Agreement on Intracranial Hemorrhage on Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Patients With Ischemic Stroke.</strong></a></p>
<p>In a prospective cohort study published in Stroke, van der Ende et al. assessed the interobserver agreement on the presence and type of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with ischemic stroke. The Heidelberg Bleeding Classification was used to classify ICH on MRI, and six observers independently rated ICH in 300 MRI scans of ischemic stroke patients treated with reperfusion therapy. The study found that the presence of any ICH can be reliably scored on MRI and can be used as a safety outcome measure in clinical stroke trials that evaluate acute interventions. The agreement of ICH types according to the Heidelberg Bleeding Classification is substantial, and disagreements are small. This study provides important information for clinicians and researchers who use MRI to evaluate ICH in patients with ischemic stroke.</p>
