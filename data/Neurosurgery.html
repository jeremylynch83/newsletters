<p>In their review article published in the Canadian Journal of Neurological Sciences, Suresh et al. discuss the ethical implications of emerging neurotechnologies for medical practice, particularly in the context of professional communication. The authors examine the challenges that physicians may face when interacting with patients, other physicians, industry, and society-at-large, and provide mitigation strategies for these issues. The rapid advances in neurotechnology and neurosurgery have the potential to revolutionize care for patients with neurological and psychiatric diseases, but ethical dilemmas regarding resource allocation, provision of care, and communication with stakeholders must be addressed. This review highlights the importance of considering the bioethical implications of novel neurotechnologies and the need for effective communication strategies to ensure their successful implementation.</p>
