<p>Here is our research update for <strong>Wednesday 03 May 2023</strong>. Three recent studies published in INR, JNIS, and ANI explore the efficacy and safety of tirofiban in patients with acute ischemic stroke, endovascular treatment strategies for simultaneous bilateral anterior circulation occlusions, and the development of a practical scoring system for intracranial dural arteriovenous fistula obliteration.</p>
<h2>Ischemic Stroke</h2>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37058772"><strong>Meta-analysis of the efficacy and safety of tirofiban in patients with acute ischaemic stroke undergoing mechanical thrombectomy.</strong></a></p>
<p>Liu et al. conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the safety and efficacy of tirofiban in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) who underwent mechanical thrombectomy. The study included 22 studies with a total of 6062 patients. The primary safety outcomes were symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH), 3-month mortality, and re-occlusion rate. The primary efficacy outcomes were good functional outcome (mRS 0-2), excellent functional outcome (mRS 0-1), and successful recanalization (mTICI≥2b). The results showed that treatment with tirofiban in patients with AIS with mechanical thrombectomy is effective in improving functional prognosis, arterial recanalization rates, and reducing 3-month mortality and re-occlusion rates, particularly in patients with large atherosclerotic stroke, without increasing the rate of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage. Intravenous administration of tirofiban significantly improves the clinical prognosis compared to arterial administration. The study provides important insights into the use of tirofiban as an adjunctive antiplatelet aggregation regimen in patients with AIS undergoing mechanical thrombectomy.</p>
<h2>Anterior Circulation Stroke</h2>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37131328"><strong>Endovascular treatment strategies for simultaneous bilateral anterior circulation occlusions in acute ischemic stroke: A single-center experience and systematic review of the literature.</strong></a></p>
<p>In a retrospective cohort study published in Interventional Neuroradiology, Bernava et al. investigated endovascular treatment strategies for simultaneous bilateral anterior circulation occlusions in acute ischemic stroke. The authors also conducted a systematic review of the literature to assess different endovascular strategies proposed for the treatment of bilateral, simultaneous anterior circulation occlusion following acute ischemic stroke. Two patients with a bilateral and simultaneous middle cerebral artery occlusion were treated at the authors' center during the study period, and a TICI score ≥2b was obtained in all occlusions. The literature review retrieved reports on 22 patients, and a combined thrombectomy technique proved to have the highest number of first-pass recanalization. In patients with bilateral and simultaneous occlusion of the anterior circulation, endovascular treatment using a combined technique appears to be rapid and effective. The clinical evolution of this patient population strongly depends on the severity of the onset symptoms.</p>
<h2>Dural Arteriovenous Fistula</h2>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37130751"><strong>The VEBAS score: a practical scoring system for intracranial dural arteriovenous fistula obliteration.</strong></a></p>
<p>In a retrospective cohort study published in the Journal of Neurointerventional Surgery, Becerril-Gaitan et al. aimed to develop a practical scoring system that predicts treatment outcomes for intracranial dural arteriovenous fistulas (dAVFs). The study used a multicenter database comprising more than 1000 dAVFs, with a subset of 80% of patients randomly selected as a training dataset and the remaining 20% used for validation. The authors found that venous stenosis, elderly age, Borden classification, arterial feeders, and past cranial surgery were independent predictors of obliteration and used to derive the VEBAS score. The VEBAS score is a practical grading system that can guide patient counseling when considering dAVF intervention by predicting the likelihood of treatment success, with higher scores portending a greater likelihood of complete obliteration. The study provides a valuable tool for predicting treatment outcomes for dAVFs, which can aid in patient counseling and decision-making.</p>
