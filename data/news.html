<p>Ischemic Stroke
Meta-analysis of the efficacy and safety of tirofiban in patients with acute ischaemic stroke undergoing mechanical thrombectomy.

<p>This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of tirofiban in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) who underwent mechanical thrombectomy. The study included 22 studies with a total of 6062 patients. The primary safety outcomes were symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH), 3-month mortality, and re-occlusion rate. The primary efficacy outcomes were good functional outcome (mRS 0-2), excellent functional outcome (mRS 0-1), and successful recanalization (mTICIâ‰¥2b). The results showed that treatment with tirofiban in patients with AIS with mechanical thrombectomy is effective in improving functional prognosis, arterial recanalization rates, and reducing 3-month mortality and re-occlusion rates, particularly in patients with large atherosclerotic stroke, without increasing the rate of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage. Intravenous administration of tirofiban significantly improves the clinical prognosis compared to arterial administration. Tirofiban is effective and safe in patients with AIS. The study provides important insights into the use of tirofiban in patients with AIS undergoing mechanical thrombectomy.</p>
<p>Ischemic Stroke
Intensive Blood Pressure Control After Mechanical Thrombectomy for Acute Ischemic Stroke.
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37021566</p>
<p>The optimal blood pressure targets following successful mechanical thrombectomy for acute ischemic stroke remain uncertain. While some studies suggest a U-shaped curve relationship between blood pressure and outcomes, others suggest a linear relationship where lower is better. The recent ENCHANTED2/mechanical thrombectomy trial, the first trial of intensive blood pressure lowering in patients with hypertension following successful mechanical thrombectomy powered to detect a difference in functional outcomes, was terminated early due to safety concerns in the more intensive blood pressure-lowering group. The high prevalence of intracranial atherosclerosis in the studied population and mechanisms for poor outcomes in patients who receive overly aggressive blood pressure reduction following successful thrombectomy, such as poststroke autoregulatory compromise and persistent microcirculatory hypoperfusion, were explored. A more moderate approach is advocated, pending further research. This study highlights the need for further research to determine the optimal blood pressure targets following successful mechanical thrombectomy for acute ischemic stroke.</p>
