<p>Here is our summary of the most relevant research for Wednesday 03 May 2023. In a recent systematic review and meta-analysis published in J Neurol, Liu et al. investigated the safety and efficacy of tirofiban in patients with acute ischemic stroke undergoing mechanical thrombectomy. Meanwhile, Bernava et al. presented a retrospective cohort study and systematic review of the literature in J Neurointerv Surg, assessing endovascular treatment strategies for simultaneous bilateral anterior circulation occlusions in acute ischemic stroke.</p>
<h2>Ischemic Stroke</h2>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37058772"><strong>Meta-analysis of the efficacy and safety of tirofiban in patients with acute ischaemic stroke undergoing mechanical thrombectomy.</strong></a></p>
<p>Liu et al. conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the safety and efficacy of tirofiban in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) who underwent mechanical thrombectomy. The study included 22 studies with a total of 6062 patients. The primary safety outcomes were symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH), 3-month mortality, and re-occlusion rate. The primary efficacy outcomes were good functional outcome (mRS 0-2), excellent functional outcome (mRS 0-1), and successful recanalization (mTICI≥2b). The results showed that treatment with tirofiban in patients with AIS with mechanical thrombectomy is effective in improving functional prognosis, arterial recanalization rates, and reducing 3-month mortality and re-occlusion rates, particularly in patients with large atherosclerotic stroke, without increasing the rate of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage. Intravenous administration of tirofiban significantly improves the clinical prognosis compared to arterial administration. The study provides important insights into the use of tirofiban as an adjunctive antiplatelet aggregation regimen in patients with AIS undergoing mechanical thrombectomy.</p>
<h2>Anterior Circulation Stroke</h2>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37131328"><strong>Endovascular treatment strategies for simultaneous bilateral anterior circulation occlusions in acute ischemic stroke: A single-center experience and systematic review of the literature.</strong></a></p>
<p>In their retrospective cohort study, Bernava et al. aimed to assess the different endovascular strategies proposed for the treatment of bilateral, simultaneous anterior circulation occlusion following acute ischemic stroke. The authors presented a retrospective study of the clinical and radiological records of all patients with a bilateral, simultaneous anterior circulation occlusion treated at their center between January 2019 and December 2022. Following the PRISMA guidelines, they also conducted a systematic review of the literature. Two patients with a bilateral and simultaneous middle cerebral artery occlusion were treated at their center during the study period. A TICI score ≥2b was obtained in 4 out of 4 occlusions. Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at 90 days was 0 and 4, respectively. The literature review retrieved reports on 22 patients. In patients with bilateral and simultaneous occlusion of the anterior circulation, endovascular treatment using a combined technique appears to be rapid and effective. The clinical evolution of this patient population strongly depends on the severity of the onset symptoms.</p>
