<p>Dacher et al. evaluated the safety and performance of ENO®, TEO®, or OTO® pacing systems with automated MRI mode at 1.5 and 3 Tesla. A total of 267 implanted patients underwent MRI examination, and MRI-related device complications, lead electrical performances stability, proper functioning of the automated MRI mode, and image quality were evaluated. The study found that freedom from MRI-related complications at 1 month post-MRI was 100% in both 1.5 and 3 T arms. The stability of pacing capture threshold and sensing was also high. All devices switched automatically to the programmed asynchronous mode in the MRI environment and to initially programmed mode after the MRI exam. While artifacts deteriorated a subset of examinations, overall interpretability was preserved. The study demonstrates the safety and electrical stability of ENO®, TEO®, or OTO® pacing systems at 1 month post-MRI at 1.5 and 3 T.</p>
